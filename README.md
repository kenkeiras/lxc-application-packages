# lxc-application-packages

This is an experiment on how easily can be leveraged LXC to build a simplistic, multi-linux-distribution meta-(package manager); an idea largely inspired by [subuser](https://github.com/subuser-security).

**Beware**: The current is an exploratory phase, so backwards compatibility is constantly broken.
